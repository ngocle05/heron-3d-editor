##  :computer: Software Description
The Heron 3D Editor lets you easily create your own custom World Building. With the ability to use a 2D grid board, you can design terrain features and then make them 3-dimensional shapes. The editor allows you to quickly and easily build your own 3D maps for beginner level,  making it the perfect low cost alternative to costly programs like Blender or Maya.

- Generate the random maze or map with the Terrain Tool or Generate Maze Tool
- Custom your own 3D model between Square or Pointy shape
- Ready-to-view 3D Preview for user to view your design map anytime
And so much more!

Download our app to explore more features and immerse yourself in your own 3D World Building!

## :hammer: Built With
- Executing the app functions through JavaFX 
- Using Eclipse as the main IDE
- Styling the app through SceneBuilder
- Implementing JUnit for multiple unit testing
- Adding Gson as the third-party for reading 3D patterns
- Applying OOP and Java from both CSC202 and CSC305

## :trophy: Accomplishments
- Genuinely proud of my team for working pair-to-pair consistently and frequently communicating with each other for implementing their wanted useful ideas
- Being able to build a highly-functional and usable software by obtaining from what we have learned so far 
- Being more proficient in git commands and solve smoothly through all conflicts
- Interacting more with SceneBuilder and JavaFX - knowing how powerful Java is 
- Fully prepared to show off our fancy software to other ACE developers, your project supervisor (me), and our clients
- Experimenting more with 3D Printers from Anycube, Dremel, Prusa, and Eiger

##  :wrench: Challenges
- Refactoring well at the beginning 
- Git add -A
- Design Choice : Canvas
- Data model
- Dependency Architecture 

## :mortar_board: Lesson Learned
- Having a good collaborative team is important to work through the big project
- Having a good design choice at the beginning does help a lot in further built-in functions and refactor

## :mag_right: Future Plan
- We aim to continue developing this into a real maintable app for users with more advanced features but still for beginner level
